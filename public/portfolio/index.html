            My design process is a collaborative and iterative journey that
            begins with understanding and defining the problem, followed by
            in-depth research and analysis. This foundation informs creative
            ideation, design, and rigorous validation. Implementation is a team
            effort, ensuring every detail enriches the user experience. The
            cycle completes with evaluation and iteration, embodying a
            commitment to excellence and continuous improvement in every
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each phase, I've provided examples detailing how I conducted
            activities, showcasing my hands-on approach to design.

                    In the "Understand & Define" phase, the core objective is to
                    comprehensively understand the project's context, including
                    a high-level overview of the current processes and tools in
                    use. This phase is pivotal in clearly defining the goals and
                    objectives of the future product and establishing a focused
                    direction for subsequent phases.

                    A noteworthy example was when I worked with one of the
                    leading insurance companies in Italy, where I facilitated a
                    "Product in a Box" session to derive the product vision
                    statement.

                      <li>
                        Based on the number of participants, we decided to go
                        with four teams. We collected four boxes and wrapped
                        them with white sheets so that each team received a
                        similar box, ensuring that the materials were ready to
                        facilitate the creative process that was to follow.

                      <li>
                        I also created a deck for introducing the concept & how
                        we will collaboratively spend the two hours.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        I introduced the "Product in a Box" concept, explaining
                        the objectives and how we would spend the next two hours
                        collaboratively. I ensured everyone understood the
                        exercise's purpose and expected outcomes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We divided participants into four teams, each comprising
                        a mix of personas to mirror a range of stakeholders and
                        potential users.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I gave clear activity instructions and asked each team
                        to engage creatively with their box, such as capturing a
                        catchy name, tagline, and key highlights on the front
                        side and critical features, benefits, and users involved
                        on each side of the box.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The teams were actively and enthusiastically involved in
                        the activity, collaborating, hearing the user
                        challenges, brainstorming about the current limitations
                        and needs, and being very creative in naming the product
                        and tagline. A few teams even created a logo and
                        competed with other teams in a fun way.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Teams then presented their boxes, adopting the role of
                        marketers selling their products. The role-play added a
                        dynamic and fun element to the exercise and allowed for
                        a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Following the presentations, we consolidated the input
                        from all the teams & used the elevator pitch template to
                        derive a unified product vision.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sub-section">

                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        By adopting a gamified format, we broke traditional
                        silos and united a wide array of stakeholders and users.
                        This strategy fostered an environment of inclusivity,
                        blending various viewpoints, expertise, user
                        requirements, and business goals to craft a cohesive and
                        effective product vision.
